My name's Renée, and I live in San Francisco! I'm from Louisiana originally, where I went to LSU (<mark style="background-color: #ffdc5de2;"><strong><span style="color:#5e22ad;">geaux tigers!</span></strong></mark>), earned a degree in Physics, and completed research that resulted in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00327-5). 

I've lived in California since 2021 and am an [engineer professionally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renee-desporte/).

I'm interested in a lot of different things: science, language, programming, music, economics, etc. This website is a space for me to [document the things I learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) and create.
