With recent talk of a [50 year mortgage](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/nx-s1-5605599/president-trump-has-proposed-a-50-year-mortgage-what-that-would-mean-for-home-buyers), I feel inspired to pick back up on [_Progress and Poverty_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_and_Poverty), [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George)'s most popular book on eliminating poverty in the modern world. In my [last post](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/10/11/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-3/), I reviewed Book 3: "The Laws of Distribution [of Wealth]", in which George concludes that

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"><mark>High <strong>rent</strong> keeps <strong>wages</strong> low.</mark></div>

(See [my first post](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/) in this series for definitions of the **bolded terms**.) In this post, I'll tackle Books 4, 5, and 6: ["Effect of Material Progress upon the Distribution of **Wealth**"](#book-4-effect-of-material-progress-upon-the-distribution-of-wealth), ["The Problem Solved"](#book-5-the-problem-solved), and ["The Remedy"](#book-6-the-remedy).

# Book 4: Effect of Material Progress upon the Distribution of **Wealth**

<div class="note">
    <p class="note-title">Note</p>
    <p>I'll be skipping chapter summaries where they feel unnecessary, e.g., for Book 4, Chapter 1.</p>
</div>

Ok, let's accept George's assertion that high **rent** causes low **wages**. <mark><em>But what causes high <strong>rent</strong>?</em></mark>

<mark><strong>Rent</strong> can increase <em>legitimately</em></mark> &mdash; <strong>land</strong> <em>actually</em> increases in value &mdash; <mark>in 2 main ways</mark>:

- <mark>increasing population</mark> density (Chapter 2)
- <mark><strong>labor</strong>-saving inventions</mark> (Chapter 3)

<mark><strong>Rent</strong> can increase <em>illegitimately</em></mark> &mdash; use of <strong>land</strong> (<strong>rent</strong>) is <em>expensive</em>, but there's <em>no actual increase in value</em> &mdash; <mark>in 1 main way</mark>: <mark>speculative <strong>land</strong> holdings</mark> (Chapter 4).

## Chapter 2: Effect of Increase of Population upon the Distribution of **Wealth**.
**Rent** increases with increasing population density (e.g., in cities) due to a _true increase in the value of **land**_. Urban **land** is _actually_ more valuable than rural **land** because 
* Productive power increases with increasing population, due to the [division of **labor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour).
* Cities offer things that rural areas don't: proximity to marketplaces, job opportunities, etc. Renters will simply pay more to live in cities (I've found this is true in my own life as well).

I highly recommend reading George's thought experiment about a settler, around whose **land** a city forms, on pages <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Progress%20and%20Poverty_3.pdf">235 &ndash; 242</a>.
## Chapter 3: Effect of Improvements in the Arts upon the Distribution of **Wealth**
**Labor**-saving inventions increase **rent** in the same way a denser population does: by increasing the productive power of **land**. More **wealth** can be extracted from **land** with a **labor**-saving invention, so the "least productive **land** in use" (see [Book 3, Chapter 2](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/10/11/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-3/#chapter-2-rent-and-the-law-of-rent)) _changes_.
> "<mark>If <strong>labor</strong>-saving inventions went on until perfection was attained</mark>, ... then everything that the earth could yield could be obtained without **labor**... **Wages** would be nothing, and **interest** would be nothing, while <mark><strong>rent</strong> would take everything</mark>... For the owners of the **land**, ... <mark>there would be no use for either <strong>labor</strong> or <strong>capital</strong>, and no possible way in which either could compel any share of the <strong>wealth</strong> produced.</mark>." (252 &ndash; 253)

In the quote below, George marvels at the paradoxical consequences of **labor**-saving inventions.

> "It seems as though these **labor**-saving inventions were in themselves a curse, and we hear men talking of work, as though the wearying strain of the muscles were, in itself, a thing to be desired." (253)

## Chapter 4: Effect of the Expectation Raised by Material Progress
<mark><strong>Rent</strong> can increase <em>illegitimately</em></mark> &mdash; use of <strong>land</strong> (<strong>rent</strong>) is <em>expensive</em>, but there's <em>no actual increase in value</em> &mdash; <mark>in 1 main way</mark>: <mark>speculative <strong>land</strong> holdings</mark>. By "speculative <strong>land</strong> holdings", George means <strong>land</strong> purchased in <em>expectation</em> of increased value in the future and then <em>held</em> in an <em>underutilized</em> condition.

# Book 5: The Problem Solved
## Chapter 1: The Primary Cause of Recurring Paroxysms of Industrial Depression
George starts Book 5 off boldly, with the claim that
<div class="important"><mark>Speculative advance in <strong>land</strong> values is the main cause of economic depression.</mark></div>

Economic depressions cyclically affect the industrialized world. George acknowledges that there are many other aspects of the modern economy that contribute to its instability, e.g., "the growing complexity and interdependence of the machinery of production" (263). However, speculative advance in **rent** is the _main_ cause (see pages 264 &ndash; 265).

Speculation is natural &mdash; human beings like to plan, anticipate. And George acknowledges that speculation occurs frequently, at a small scale, without much impact on the economy:

> "In agricultural or mineral productions, or manufactured goods, for the effect of speculation in such things ... is simply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady the interplay of production and consumption by an action analogous to that of a fly-wheel in a machine" (267)

However, it's _much_ more difficult for the economy to recover from **land** speculation because <mark><strong>land</strong> is a fixed quantity</mark>, i.e., supply can't increase to compensate. The result? <mark><strong>Monopolies</strong> on <strong>land</strong></mark>.

George argues that the cycle between <strong>land</strong> speculation and economic bust is obvious, especially in the United States (see page 268). The ironic thing is that speculative **land** purchases _always_ accompany material progress. Society is suffering from success:
<div style="text-align: center;">Everywhere <strong>land</strong> values have been steadily increasing with material progress, and everywhere this increase begot a speculative advance... <mark>a world-wide depression of industry and commerce, begotten of a world-wide material progress.</mark></div>

## Chapter 2: The Persistence of Poverty Amid Advancing **Wealth**
George has now fully outlined his theory which explains the problem for which this book is named:
<div class="important">
  <mark>Widespread <em>poverty</em> despite material <em>progress</em> is caused by <em>high <strong>rent</strong></em></mark>, which is in turn caused by <strong>land monopolies</strong> brought about by speculative purchases and holding of <strong>land</strong>.
</div>

This theory, George argues, explains every economic observation to date (see page 287):
- Why low **wages** exist despite high productive power;
- Why **interest** and **wages** are lower in more-developed countries;
- Why **labor**-saving inventions don't benefit **labor** _or_ **capital** &mdash; just **land**-owners;
- "Why free trade fails to benefit permanently the working classes" (287);
- Why **wealth** tends to "aggregate";
- Why economic depressions occur;
- Why poverty increases with population density.

# Book 6: The Remedy
## Chapter 1: Insufficiency of Remedies Currently Advocated
In this chapter, George considers existing ideas in alleviating poverty, which he groups into 6 sections.
1. Change in government
  - Can we blame monarchical or aristocratic governments for widespread poverty? Yes and no.
  - Say we overthrow a king (which we did, in 1783) and greatly reduce taxes. Would the poorest of society benefit? Maybe for a little while, but &mdash; as we've seen in the U.S. since the Revolutionary War &mdash; these benefits are short-lived.
  - In short: "reduction in the expenses of government can have no direct effect in extirpating poverty and increasing **wages**, so long as **land** is monopolized" (303).
2. Better education for the poor
  - "Maybe people are poor because they're dumb and lazy," some may say.
  - George says, that's besides the point.
  - Sure, a **laborer** could work _more_ hours to earn _more_ money, but the **wages** as a whole are out of his control.
  - "To make people industrious, prudent, skillful, and intelligent, they must be relieved from want" (310).
3. Unions
  - George argues that unions are too difficult to organize and overall destructive &mdash; they allow **wealth** to go to waste.
  - Furthermore, the changes enacted by unions are never long-lasting.
4. [Cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative)
  - George argues that cooperatives are redundant and powerless as **land monopolies** are still broadly allowed.
  - Cases where cooperatives have worked have been _isolated_. Like unions, their results cannot be wide-spread or long-lasting.
5. Socialism
  > The ideal of socialism is grand and noble; and it is, I am convinced, possible of realization; but such a state of society cannot be manufactured &mdash; it must grow. Society is an organism, not a machine. It can live only by the individual life of its parts. And in the free and natural development of all the parts will be secured the harmony of the whole. All that is necessary to social regeneration is included in the motto of those Russian patriots sometimes called Nihilists &mdash; '**Land** and Liberty!' (321)
6. Re-distribution of or restrictions to **land** ownership
  - _Restricting_ **land** ownership by size "is like that of the monkey, who, dividing the cheese between the cats, equalized matters by taking a bite off the biggest piece", according to George (324).
  - On the other hand, say we _re-distribute_ existing **land** fairly. What would prevent the system from re-evolving into its current unbalanced state?
  > "The subdivision of **land** can thus do nothing to cure the evils of **land** monopoly, while it can have no effect in raising **wages** or in improving the condition of the lowest classes, its tendency is to prevent the adoption or even advocacy of more thorough-going measures, and to strengthen the existing unjust system by interesting a larger number in its maintenance." (326)

What is "<mark>the true remedy?</mark>"

# Conclusion

<blockquote><p>"<mark>The great cause of inequality in the distribution of <strong>wealth</strong> is inequality in the ownership of <strong>land</strong>.</mark>" (295)</p>"This ... is the remedy for the unjust and unequal distribution of <strong>wealth</strong> apparent in modern civilization, and for all the evils which flow from it:<div style="text-align: center;"><mark>We must make <strong>land</strong> common property."</mark></div> (328)</blockquote>

I'll be honest, I'm not sure how Henry George plans to make this idea actionable or acceptable... I guess we'll see next time!

# Addendum
**Quote 1:** George on access to **land** and creation of **wealth**.
> "Man creates nothing. The whole human race, were they to **labor** forever, could not create the tiniest mote that floats in a sunbeam &mdash; could not make this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter. In producing **wealth**, **labor** ... but works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter, and, to produce **wealth**, must, therefore, have access to this matter and to these forces &mdash; that is to say, to **land**. <mark>The <strong>land</strong> is the source of all <strong>wealth</strong>.</mark>" (272)

**Quote 2:**
> "Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of **land** is the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of power." (296)
