I migrated it to [my website](https://reneedesporte.github.io/jekyll/github%20pages/2025/10/22/setting-up-my-website-with-github-pages-and-jekyll.html) (written in `markdown` for Jekyll) partially using ChatGPT.

Almost everything I write about here I learned from Modern Persian: A Complete Course for Beginners by John Mace. Another great resource is [Persian Language Online](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1991829543020552279/2251805351535458500#). These two sources are much more valuable than this article will be.

I’ve used the word “alphabet” in the title of this article, but the Arabic script isn’t really an alphabet in the strictest linguistic sense. It’s an impure “abjad”. More on that [here](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1991829543020552279/2251805351535458500#).

I’ll number the letters here so I can easily keep track of which ones I’ve documented.
There are 32 letters total. This may not be the order in which the Arabic letters are typically taught, and there are likely more logical groupings than I’ve assigned here.
But this article is for me, not you :)

# Letters in Farsi

#### 1. Âlef: ا

The first letter of the Arabic alphabet (or at least the first one that John Mace introduces) is âlef: ا.
It is not equivalent to the letter A in English pronunciation. John Mace describes the pronunciation of this vowel as something between “ah” and “oh”.
Listen to any Persian speak and you’ll hear this sound a lot, such as in the words آب (âb: water) or آره (âreh: yeah).

When beginning a word, âlef is capitalized with a hat: آ.
It will join to letters before it, as in با (bâ: with), but does not join to the letters after it, as in آب.

#### 2. B: ب

The letter ب is pronounced like the letter B in English and is used in words such as آب (âb: water) and بابا (bâbâ: dad).

ب shortens when at the beginning of a word, as in با, but stays in its longer form when ending a word, as in آب. In the middle of a word, it is a small peak, with only its dot below to indicate its presence, as in سبد (sabad: basket).

#### 3. N: ن

The letter ن is pronounced like the letter N in English and is used in words like نان (nân: bread) and نام (nâm: name). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ب, with only the dot placement changed.

#### 4. T: ت

The letter ت is pronounced like the letter T in English and is used in words like تا (tâ: until) and پسته (pesteh: pistachio). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ب, with only the dot placement changed.

#### 5. P: پ

The letter پ is pronounced like the letter P in English and is used in words like پسته and پنج (panj: five). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ب, with only the dot placement changed.

#### 6. S: ث

The letter ث is pronounced like S in English. It’s used in words like ثبت (sabat: record).
This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ب, with only the dot placement changed.

## د Type Letters

Besides âlef, all of the letters I’ve mentioned so far have been of the ب form, i.e., they behave like the letter B within words. Now we’ll move on to letters of a different category.

#### 7. D: د

The letter د is pronounced like D in English, and is used in words like بد (bad: bad) and دو (doe: two). د will not connect to letters following it but will connect to letters preceding it, similar to âlef.

#### 8. R: ر

The letter ر is pronounced like the Spanish R, which is rolled. It’s used in words like آره and روز (rooz: day). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter د.

#### 9. Z: ز

The letter ز is pronounced like the English Z. It’s used in words like روز and زن (zan: woman). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter د.

#### 10. V, -oo, -oh: و

The letter و can either be pronounced as the English V, the long vowel sound “oo”, or the short vowel sound “oh”. It’s used in words like و (va: and), روز, and دو. This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter د.

#### 11. Z: ذ

The letter ذ is pronounced like the English Z. It’s used in words like ذرت (zorat: corn). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter د.

#### 12. Zh: ژ

The letter ژ is pronounced like the “ge” at the end of the word beige in English. It’s used in words like ژله (zheleh: jelly). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter د.

## ح Type Letters

#### 13. H: ح

The letter ح is pronounced like the letter H in English. It’s used in words like صبح (sobh: morning) and حوله (holeh: towel). This letter connects to letters preceding and following it.

#### 14. J: ج

The letter ج is pronounced like the letter J in English and is used in words like ثنج. This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ح and only differs in dot placement.

#### 15. Kh: خ

The letter خ doesn’t have an English equivalent. It’s used in words such as خوب (khoob: good). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ح and only differs in dot placement.

#### 16. Ch: چ

The letter چ is pronounced like “ch” in English, as in change. In Farsi, it’s often used in interrogatory words, such as چی (chee: what) and چرا (cherâ: why). This letter’s behavior within words mimics the letter ح and only differs in dot placement.

## س Type Letters

#### 17. S: س

The letter س is pronounced like S in English and is used in words like سن (senn: age), بس (bas: enough), and سگ (sag: dog).
س connects to letters before and after it, and loses its tail when not at the end of a word.

#### 18. Sh: ش

The letter ش is pronounced like “sh” in English and is used in words like شام (shâm: dinner) and شوما (shomâ: you). This letter follows the same behavioral rules within words as س.

#### 19. S: ص

The letter ص is pronounced like the English S and is used in words like صد (sad: one hundred). This letter follows the same behavioral rules within words as س.

#### 20. Z: ض

The letter ض is pronounced like the English Z and is used in words like ضد (zed: opposite) and مریض (mareez: sick). This letter follows the same behavioral rules within words as س.

## Other Letter Groupings
### (K) ک, (G) گ, and (L) ل
The following letters are grouped together in John Mace’s book, so I’ve also grouped them here.

#### 21. K: ک

The letter ک is pronounced like K in English and is used in words like کادو (kâdo: gift) and کریسمس (krees-mas: Christmas). It connects to letters before and after it, but generally maintains the same shape.

#### 22. G: گ

The letter گ is pronounced like the English G and is used in words like گرم (garm: warm) and سنگ (sang: stone). This letter’s behavior matches that of ک exactly.

#### 23. L: ل

The letter ل is pronounced like the letter L in English and is used in words like گل (gol: flower) and لباس (lebâs: film).
The letter ل may resemble ا, but it differs from âlef in that it connects to letters following it.

### More Unique Letters
The following three letters are fairly unique in my opinion, so I’ve ironically grouped them together for being special.

#### 24. M: م

The letter م is pronounced like the English M and is very common in Farsi. It’s used in words like شوما and نم. It joins with letters before and after it, and maintains a tail when ending a word.

#### 25. H, -eh: ه

The letter ه can represent an H consonant sound, or it can represent the vowel sound -eh at the end of a word. It’s used in words like آره (âreh) as a vowel, and in words like هوا (havâ: air, weather) and بهار (bahâr: spring) as a consonant. This letter joins with letters before and after it and has a unique form in the middle of a word, e.g., بهار.

#### 26. -ee, -ya: ی

The letter ی represents a long vowel sound -ee, as in “Greek” or “eager.” In Farsi, it’s used in words like اینجا (een-jâ: here) and ایرانی (ee-râ-nee: Iranian). This letter connects to letters preceding and following it. At the beginning or middle of a word, ی takes on two dots below it, e.g., اینجا. If ی begins a word, a dummy âlef must precede it. At the end of a word, ی maintains its tail.

#### 27. F: ف

The letter ف sounds like F in English. It’s used in the words فارسی (fârs-ee: Farsi) and کیف (keef: bag). The ف links with preceding and subsequent letters.

#### 28. Gh: ق

The letter ق doesn’t have an English equivalent; it’s similar to the French R sound. It’s used in words such as قفل (ghofl: lock). It mimics the letter ف in behavior within words.

#### 29. T: ط

The letter ط is pronounced like the English T and is used in words like طلا (talâ: gold) and خط (khat: script, line). It connects with letters preceding and following it, and looks the same at all points within a word.

#### 30. Z: ظ

The letter ظ is pronounced like the English Z. It’s used in words like کدا هافظ (kodâ hâfez: goodbye). It mimics the behavior of its sibling, ط.

#### 31. ‘Ain: ع

The letter ع represents a glottal stop, such as in the phrase “wa’er bo’le” in a Cockney accent. In Farsi, it appears in words like معلم (mo’alem: teacher). It takes on a unique form at the beginning, middle, and end of words.

#### 32. Ghain: غ

There is no English equivalent to the letter غ. It’s pronounced similar to a G, but further back in the throat. It’s used in words like تیغ (teegh: razor). It mirrors its sibling, ‘ain, in behavior within words.

# Conclusion

I wrote this descriptive article as
1.	an exercise to go through all the letters used in written Persian and
2.	a reference for myself as I continue to learn Farsi.

P.S. Things I don’t understand yet:
1.	Where to use which consonant letter &mdash; for example, there are four letters for the Z sound. Which one goes where?
2.	How to infer from reading which short vowel to use? For example, is بد pronounced bad, bed, or bid? Maybe it just comes with practice.
