</div>

In this edition of [my summary series](https://www.reneedesporte.com/progress-and-poverty) on Henry George's _Progress and Poverty_, I'll be covering Books 7 & 8: [Justice of the Remedy](#book-7-justice-of-the-remedy) and [Application of the Remedy](#book-8-application-of-the-remedy). Let's recap of the book so far (see [my previous posts](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/) for definitions of **bolded** terms):
- The main question of _Progress and Poverty_ is (as the title suggests) "why does _poverty_ seem to increase despite material _progress_?"
    - By _poverty_, George typically means low **wages**.
    - By material _progress_, George means both
        1. The increase in produced **wealth**
        2. The increase in society's _ability_ to produce **wealth** (via "[**labor**-saving inventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution)", [division of **labor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour), etc.)
- While [many have deliberated on this question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality#Perspectives), Henry George asserts that <mark>poverty is caused by private ownership of <strong>land</strong></mark>.
- His ["Remedy"](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/11/18/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-4/#conclusion), therefore, is "make **land** common property" (George, 328).

# Book 7: Justice of the Remedy
Book 7 is dedicated to the justification of [the Remedy](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/11/18/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-4/#conclusion).

## Chapter 1: The Injustice of Private Proverty in **Land**
George asserts 3 points in this chapter:
1. Each person has a right to own any **wealth** created with their **labor**.
    - I kill a deer? I own that deer's meat.
    - I weave a basket? I own that basket.
2. Because **wealth** can be _exchanged_, _any_ **wealth** &mdash; that is, anything created with **labor** &mdash; can be property.
    - I trade you some of my deer meat for a carrots? I have a _right_ to own those carrots, as if I grew them myself.
3. Finally, <mark><strong>land</strong> can <em>never</em> be rightfully owned</mark> because it isn't (by definition) created by **labor**.
    - **Land**: anything provided freely by Nature.

> "The equal right of all men to the use of **land** is as clear as their equal right to breathe the air &mdash; it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence. For we cannot suppose that some men have a right to be in this world and others no right." (George, 338)

Some may claim a right to **land** via settling or conquest. To this, George asks:
> "Does the first passenger who enters a railroad car obtain the right to scatter his baggage over all the seats and compel the passengers who come in after him to stand up?" (345)

## Chapter 2: The Enslavement of Laborers the Ultimate Result of Private Property in **Land**
Private **land** ownership will _always_ increase **rent** and decrease **wages** to their minimum. In this way, <mark>private <strong>land</strong> ownership is equivilant to slavery</mark>. George argues that this is evident in _every civilization_ with a **land**-owning class throughout history &mdash; the Egyptians, the Spartans, in India, the American South:
> "Now that slavery has been abolished, the planters of the South find they have sustained no loss. Their ownership of the **land** upon which the freedmen must live gives them practically as much command of **labor** as before..." (354)

## Chapter 3: Claim of **Land** Owners to Compensation
George's Remedy: Make land common property. George argues that achieving that Remedy _cannot_ involve compensation for land owners, since their ownership is an injustice. Moreover, he notes that:
> "The anti-slavery movement in the United States commenced with talk of compensating owners, but when four millions of slaves were emancipated, the owners got no compensation, nor did they clamor for any." (362)

**Land** owners _should_, however, be compensated for their "improvements to the **land**", such as the houses they built.

## Chapter 4: Private Property in **Land** Historically Considered
Private **land** ownership, while a core tenet of the modern Western world, wasn't unbiquitous throughout history (see [Quote 4](#quote-4-george-quoting-emile-de-laveleye)). There are many documented cases of ancient societies in which **land** was common property. What _is_ historically universal, George claims, is the way in which **land** moves from community care to private hands: through _force_ (see [Quote 5](#quote-5-george-on-the-historical-consistencies-of-land-ownership-and-conquest)). 

Not only is the **land** unjustly seized, George argues that societies built on private **land** ownership are unstable. One notable example is that of the Roman Empire, whose agricultural economic system was based on [slave **labor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latifundium). The Roman author [Pliny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder) believed these farming estates were the downfall of the empire:

<div class="important">
    <p>"Latifundia perdidere Italiam."</p>
    <p class="important-subtext" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em>"Great estates ruined Italy."</em></p>
    <p class="important-subtext" style="margin-top: 0">Henry George, quoting <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/18*.html">Pliny</a></p>
</div>

George goes on to discuss the fall of the Roman empire and the feudal system that replaced it, which ironically "was a triumph of the idea of the common right to **land**" (377). In ancient France and England, "[**The commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)... embraced a very large proportion of the area of most European countries." (378) These European commons have mostly been lost in the modern age, primarily due to changing laws.

## Chapter 5: Of Property in **Land** in the United States
The United States is a country founded on the ideas of private property in **land**, an idea which it inherited from its parent, Britain. However, because America has _so much **land**_, she has not (or had not yet, in George's era) felt the full effects of private **land** ownership and monopolization. George argues that <mark>it is this </mark>(quasi-)<mark>free access to <strong>land</strong> which has made America great</mark> (see [Quote 6](#quote-6-the-american-people-and-free-access-to-land)).

But this is a begone era. American expansion has pushed as far as it can go &mdash; the last properties on the Monopoly board have been bought up &mdash; and the U.S. now resembles the old countries of England and Irleand, whose tenants grow poorer by the year.

## Chapter 3: The Proposition Tried by the Canons of Taxation

<div class="important">
    <p>"It is not necessary to confiscate <strong>land</strong>; it is only necessary to confiscate <strong>rent</strong>."</p>
    <p class="important-subtext">George, 405</p>
</div>

<div class="floating-section" style="background: rgb(237, 237, 237); width: auto; text-align: center;">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"><strong>land</strong> value tax</a> = <strong>rent</strong> tax</p>
</div>

In general, Henry George hates taxes, since "taxation which lessens the reward of the producer necessarily lessens the incentive to production" (409). However, artificially high **rent** (due to [speculative **land** holdings](https://www.reneedesporte.com/2025/11/18/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-4/#chapter-1-the-primary-cause-of-recurring-paroxysms-of-industrial-depression), i.e., [monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_price)) _already_ checks production (as George has explained in countless ways). 

Taxing **rent** is therefore the _only_ tax that _increases production_ by dissolving these speculative **land** holdings (hoardings?):
> "If **land** were taxed to anything near its **rental** value, no one could afford to hold **land** that he was not using, and, consequently, **land** not in use would be thrown open to those who would use it." (413)

## Chapter 4: Indorsements and Objections
Other economists, e.g., [Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo) and [Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill), had already endorsed **rent** taxes before George wrote _Progress and Poverty_ in the late 1800s. Others disagreed. I'll likely write a separate post on this debate some other time.

# Conclusion
In Books 7 & 8, Henry George finally arrived at the conclusion I've been waiting for: <mark>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"><strong>land</strong> value tax</a></mark>, though the practical implementation of this tax is not yet fully clear to me.

# Addendum
### Quote 1
> "The masses of men, who in the midst of abundance suffer want; who, clothed with political freedom, are condemned to the wages of slavery; to whose toil labor-saving inventions bring no relief, but rather seem to rob them of a privilege, instinctively feel that "_there is something wrong_." **And they are right**." (340)

### Quote 2
> "It was not nobility that gave **land**, but the possession of **land** that gave nobility." (351)

### Quote 3:
> "Private ownership of **land** is the nether millstone. Material progress is the upper millstone. Between them, with an increasing pressure, the working classes are being ground." (357)

### Quote 4: George quoting historian [Emile de Laveleye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_de_Laveleye) on joint **land** ownership in "primitive" societies
> "In all primitive societies, the soil was the joint property of the tribes and was subject to periodical distribution among all the families, so that all might live by their **labor** as nature has ordained. The comfort of each was thus proportioned to his energy and intelligence; no one, at any rate, was destitute of the means of subsistence, and inequality increasing from generation to generation was provided against." (371)

### Quote 5: George on the historical consistencies of **land** ownership and conquest
> "These causes may be summarized as the concentration of power in the hands of chieftains and the military class, consequent on a state of warfare, which enabled them to monopolize common **lands**; the effect of conquest, in reducing the conquered to a state of predial slavery, and dividing their **lands** among the conquerors, and in disproportionate share to the chiefs; the differentiation and influence of a sacerdotal class, and the differentiation and influence of a class of professional lawyers, whose interests were served by the substitution of exclusive, in place of common, property in **land** inequality once produced always tending to greater inequality, by the law of attraction." (372)

### Quote 6: The American people and free access to **land**
> "The general intelligence, the general comfort, the active invention, the power of adaptation and assimilation, the free, independent spirit, the energy and hopefulness that have marked our people, are not causes, but results &mdash; <em>they have sprung from unfenced <strong>land</strong></em>... In America, whatever his condition, there has always been the consciousness that the public domain lay behind him; and the knowledge of this fact, acting and reacting, has penetrated our whole national life, giving to it generosity and independence, elasticity and ambition." (390)

### Quote 7: Anecdote about public versus private **land** ownership and habitat maintenance
> "It would be difficult to select any portion of the territory of the United States in which the conditions commonly taken to necessitate the reduction of **land** to private ownership exist in higher degree than on the little islets of St. Peter and St. Paul, in the Aleutian Archipelago, acquired by the Alaska purchase from Russia. These islands are the breeding places of the fur seal, an animal so timid and wary that the slightest fright causes it to abandon its accustomed resort, never to return. To prevent the utter destruction of this fishery, without which the islands are of no use to man, it is not only necessary to avoid killing the females and young cubs, but even such noises as the discharge of a pistol or the barking of a dog. The men who do the killing must be in no hurry, but quietly walk around among the seals who line the rocky beaches, until the timid animals, so clumsy on **land** but so graceful in water, show no more sign of fear than lazily to waddle out of the way. Then those who can be killed without diminution of future increase are carefully separated and gently driven inland, out of sight and hearing of the herds, where they are dispatched with clubs. To throw such a fishery as this open to whoever chose to go and kill &mdash; which would make it to the interest of each party to kill as many as they could at the time without reference to the future &mdash; would be utterly to destroy it in a few seasons, as similar fisheries in other oceans have been destroyed." (400 &ndash; 401)
