Today I'll be demonstrating destructive acoustic interference &mdash; the main principle behind Active Noise Control &mdash; with Python and a simple stereo speaker! The code I wrote and used lives on GitHub. Before we jump into how it works, take a look at the before and after:

It's not perfect, but it's still cool to see (hear) some effect!

# My Approach

Destructive interference has been explained time and time again, but honestly I think this picture from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control) explains it best:

I wanted to demonstrate the most basic case: a plain sine wave. 

My code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/reneedesporte/destructive_acoustic_interference/tree/main). It essentially does what's demonstrated in the graphic above. I output a 400 Hz sine wave from one channel of my laptop speakers and a 180Â° phase shifted 400 Hz sine wave from the other channel. When you stand in the right spot, the sound becomes muted!

# Conclusion
This was a really simple experiment to put together. Maybe in the future I'll try detecting real noise and inverting it real-time, like noise-cancelling headphones.
