I was inspired to migrate [my old blog](https://reneelearnsthings.blogspot.com/) from Blogger to GitHub Pages â€” thanks [Nicky](https://www.nickymasso.com/)!

## Step-By-Step
Setting up this website was pretty easy to do. I followed [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart):
1. **Create a [repo](https://github.com/reneedesporte/reneedesporte.github.io)**, which contains the code (`HTML`, etc.) that GitHub will [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) on their end.
2. **Set up a [publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)**. I chose the `main` branch of my repo.
3. **Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides)** on my local machine. Jekyll is a software that makes static site building easy and sleek (check out [this video](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q?si=2iACw0J96wzDSeDM) for a quick overview of Jekyll). I decided to use Jekyll because
  - [GitHub recommended it](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll);
  - Writing `markdown` is easier than writing `HTML`;
  - There are a lot of fun [templates](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) to choose from.
4. **[Initialize my existing repo](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31653123)** with all the Jekyll stuff.
5. **Customize the website** with links to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renee-desporte/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/reneedesporte), posts like this one, etc.

That's really all there is to it! Next, I'll migrate [all of my old blog posts](https://reneelearnsthings.blogspot.com/) to this site (and update them using Jekyll's format).
