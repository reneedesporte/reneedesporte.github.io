- **_Hiragana_** and **_katakana_** are letters, i.e., they represent sounds.
    - **_Hiragana_** is generally used for words of Japanese origin.
    - **_Katakana_** is generally used for loanwords.
- **_Kanji_** are borrowed Chinese characters, and represent both sound and meaning.

# Hiragana
- There are 46 syllables.
- Diacritical marks and subsequent letters can be added to change the letter's sound.
- Consonants are doubled in certain words, which alters normal pronunciation.
    - The same is true for vowel sounds.
- Some vowels are dropped in certain words.
- Pitch also has an effect on Japanese words.
    - Syllables are pronounced in either a high or low pitch, but remain equal in length and stress.

# Katakana
- **_Katakana_** is essentially the same as **_hiragana_**, i.e., there are 46 letters, diacritical marks, etc.
    - It's like print versus cursive in English, based on my first impression.
- As previously mentioned, these letters are usually used for words borrowed from other languages.

# Kanji
- **_Kanji_**, as previously stated, represent both sound and meaning.
- There are two types of **_kanji_**: **_on-yomi_** and **_kun-yomi_**.
- **_On-yomi_** are Chinese reading of Kanji characters.
    - I believe this means that the Kanji character would sound and mean the same thing in both China and Japan.
- **_Kun-yomi_** are **_kanji_** used to write native Japanese words.
    - I believe this refers to **_kanji_** characters which either do not exist in Chinese or represent something different in Japan than in China.
