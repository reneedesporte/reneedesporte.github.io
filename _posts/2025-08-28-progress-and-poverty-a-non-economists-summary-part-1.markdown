I'm not an economist, but I'm currently experiencing a bit of Henry George monomania. My interest was first peaked a long time ago by [this Mr. Beat video](youtube.com/watch?si=m5CZPiAff_MvaVD3&v=6c5xjlmLfAw&feature=youtu.be) and has since been reignited by my living in San Francisco, [where George first started his career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George#Personal_life).

I'm not saying that I like Henry George as a person or that I agree with his theories.

But his [_Progress and Poverty_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_and_Poverty) was a seminal piece of economic writing, which I'd like to understand &mdash; _not_ necessarily claim as correct &mdash; and summarize as concisely as possible. _Progress and Poverty_ is long enough that I need to break down my summary into a series. This is part 1 of that series, based on the "Introduction" and "Book 1: Wages and Capital".

# Introduction
Why has "progress" &mdash; the "increase in **wealth**-producing power", such as that provided by the Industrial Revolution &mdash; not alleviated poverty in society? This is George's main question. In a poetic way, George observes that
> "The new forces, elevating in their nature though they be, do not act upon the social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time hoped and believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top and bottom. <mark>It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not underneath society, but through society.</mark> Those who are above the point of separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down." (George, 9)

# Book 1: Wages and Capital
## Chapter 1: The Current Doctrine of Wages &mdash; its Insufficiency
Using economic terms (**bolded**), George re-asks his original question:
> "Why, in spite of increase in **productive** power, do **wages** tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living?" (17)

"Political economists" (so George calls himself and his field of study) of the time believed that **wages** were controlled by two factors: amount of **capital** and number of laborers. It appears that Adam Smith &mdash; father of this period's economic thought and author of [_The Wealth of Nations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations) &mdash; was the first (or one of the first) proponent(s) of this idea.

George argues that this belief (**wages** are limited by **capital**) is _wrong_ based on the observed relationship between **wages** and **interest** &mdash; they are _positively correlated_. If these terms are as unfamiliar to you as they were to me, you'll be grateful for the Chapter 2...

## Chapter 2: The Meaning of the Terms
There are a few terms that George spends time defining, as well as some others whose meanings I've inferred to the best of my ability, which total to 7 basic economic terms:

- **Land**: Naturally occurring material things, i.e., things supplied by nature.
- **Labor**: The efforts of mankind.
- **Wealth**: Non-naturally occurring (man-made) material things, i.e, **land** modified by **labor**.
    - Must be _exchangeable_, e.g., health is _not_ **wealth**, as it can't be transferred between people.
    - Must have a _net positive impact on society_, e.g., debt is not **wealth** as no real value has been added to society &mdash; one man becomes rich at another's expense, resulting in a net zero value.
- **Capital**: A type of **wealth** devoted to generating more **wealth**.
- **Rent**: The return for the use of **land**.
- **Wages**: The return for the use of **labor**.
- **Interest**: The return for the use of **capital**.

I've visualized the relationship between these terms in the Figure 1.

![Economic terms](/assets/img/henry_george_part_one__economic_terms.png) **Figure 1: The relationship between economic terms according to George.**

George axiomatically states that "**land**, **labor**, and **capital** are the three factors of production [of **wealth**]" (38). These three concepts are _mutually exclusive_ and can be used if one provides **rent**, **wages**, or **interest** respectively.

It should be noted that while **labor** is required to create **wealth**, it is not exclusively used for this purpose. **Labor** can, of course, also be used to render services.

I think examples are always helpful to help cement ideas such as those defined above, so I'll provide a more modern example than those George provides: a Minecraft example.

### Minecraft Example

When you start a new Minecraft world, you have nothing except the nature around you: the dirt, the trees, the animals (**land**). You start by punching a tree (**labor**), which results in logs (**wealth**: **land** modified by **labor**). You turn the logs into planks (more **labor**) and then into a crafting table. This crafting table is then a physical resource used to make more resources: **capital**. From then on in the game, you utilize a combination of **land**, **labor** and **capital** to continue accruing **wealth**.

![Minecraft example](/assets/img/henry_george_part_one__minecraft_example.png) **Figure 2: Land, labor, and capital in Minecraft.**

I won't discuss **rent**, **wages**, or **interest** yet &mdash; George tackles these more in later chapters. For now, I'll just acknowledge that these three terms represent the stimulus needed for the use of **land**, **labor**, and **capital** respectively.

## Chapter 3: Wages not Drawn from Capital, but Produced by the Labor

George begins this chapter by disproving the "**wages** are derived from **capital**" belief using counterexamples, such as

> "If I take a piece of leather and work it up into a pair of shoes, the shoes are my **wages** &mdash; the reward of my exertion. Surely they are not drawn from **capital** &mdash; either my **capital** or anyone else's **capital** &mdash; but are brought into existence by the **labor** of which they become the **wages**." (50)

He then re-asserts his claim that

> "It is from the produce of **labor**, not from the advances of **capital** that **wages** come" (56).

He inductively reasons this from a variety of thought experiments and examples.

## Chapter 4: Laborers not Maintained by Capital

This chapter is also dedicated to examples wherein **wages** are _not_ derived from **capital**.

## Chapter 5: The Real Function of Capital

If the function of **capital** is not to produce **wages**, then what is its purpose? George claims that **capital** is used to _increase the power of **labor**_.

He concludes the chapter and Book 1 by stating

> "If **wages** are drawn, not from **capital**, but from the produce of **labor**, the current theories as to the relations of **capital** and **labor** are invalid, and all remedies ... which look to the alleviation of poverty either by the increase of **capital** or the restriction of the number of laborers or the efficiency of their work, must be condemned." (88)

The problem (poverty, in the face of progress) can only be solved by reframing our mindset and beliefs.

# Conclusion
George adamantly claims, and illustrates through imagined scenarios and examples, that <mark><strong>wages</strong> are determined after <strong>labor</strong> has been performed by the <strong>wealth</strong> it creates</mark> and that <mark><strong>capital</strong> does not control <strong>wages</strong>, nor does it necessarily</mark> (though it can) <mark>limit industry</mark>.
