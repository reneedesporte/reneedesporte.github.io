Welcome to episode 3 of my summary series on Henry George's _Progress and Poverty_, his most seminal work. In my [last post](https://reneedesporte.github.io/2025/09/10/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-2/), I summarized George's points against Thomas Malthus and his theory on Population and Subsistence. Combining these arguments with those that George makes in [Book 1](https://reneedesporte.github.io/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/), we arrive again at George's main question:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <mark>What <em>economic</em> laws can explain poverty in the face of increasing wealth-producing power?</mark>
</div>

This post will tackle "Book III: The Laws of Distribution" [of Wealth]. It is a hefty section &mdash; the densest so far &mdash; so buckle up.
> `NOTE`: If you'd rather skip the ride, (because to be frank I included a lot of unnecessary quotes and explanations &mdash; I just really like the way Henry George writes) please jump ahead to ["Chapter 8: The Statics of the Problem Thus Explained"](#chapter-8-the-statics-of-the-problem-thus-explained).

# Book 3: The Laws of Distribution
## Chapter 1: The Inquiry Narrowed to the Laws of Distribution &mdash; The Necessary Relation of These Laws
George begins this chapter by reiterating his previous points, namely that **wages** are not limited by **capital** (or subsistence) but are determined by the laws of **wealth** distribution. To recapitulate what we already know, **wealth** is produced by three factors &mdash; **land**, **labor**, and **capital** &mdash; before being re-distributed into three categories &mdash; **rent**, **wages**, and **interest**. 

I should note that **wealth** is _wholly_ re-distributed into **rent**, **wages**, and **interest**, i.e., there's no such thing as left-over or excess **wealth** &mdash; it all goes back into the **wealth**-production cycle (see [Addendum Quote 1](#quote-1)).

I'll update my figure from [part 1](https://reneedesporte.github.io/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/) of this series to show the complete cycle:

![Full wealth distribution cycle](/assets/img/henry_george_full_wealth_distribution_cycle.png) **Figure 1: The means of production of wealth and its distribution to rent, wages, and interest.**

George also introduces a new term in this chapter: profits, which is a synonym for **wealth** (see [Addendum Quote 2](#quote-2)).

George's main goal is to map out the ways in which **wealth** gets distributed to **rent**, **wages** and **interest**. Historically, economists had viewed **capital** as the driving economic force with "the capitalist as the central figure" (163). But George has already proved in [previous chapters](https://reneedesporte.github.io/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/) that **capital** is _not necessary_ to produce **wealth** &mdash; only **land** and **labor** (remember my Minecraft metaphor from Part 1?). 

Of **land** and **labor**, George argues that <mark><strong>land</strong> is the primary driver of <strong>wealth</strong> production</mark>:

> "**Labor** is the active and initial force, and **labor** is therefore the employer of **capital**. **Labor** can be exerted only upon **land**, and it is from **land** that the matter which it transmutes into **wealth** must be drawn. **Land** therefore is the condition precedent, the field and material of **labor**. The natural order is **land**, **labor**, **capital**; and, instead of starting from **capital** as our initial point, <mark>we should start from <strong>land</strong></mark>." (163)

Once the law of **rent** has been determined, the other two laws of distribution (**wages** and **interest**) will naturally follow because all three laws are proportional, such that "any two being given the third may be inferred" (160).

## Chapter 2: Rent and the Law of Rent
The law of **rent** (which, remember, is the return for the use of _bare_ **land**, _not_ any **wealth** on the **land**, e.g., houses) was already known and widely accepted in George's time. It is sometimes called "[Ricardo's law of **rent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_rent)":

> "The **rent** of **land** is determined by the excess of its **produce** over that which the same application can secure from the least productive **land** in use." (168)

I think it's a bit confusing, and Henry George's contemporary [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) agreed, apparently calling it the "[pons asinorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_asinorum)" of economics. Let's reword it like this:

> The **rent** of **land** is determined by <span style="color: red;">the difference in <strong>wealth</strong> produced on it</span> ~~excess of its produce over that which~~ (<span style="color: red;">given</span> the same <span style="color: red;">inputted <strong>labor</strong> and <strong>capital</strong></span>) ~~application can secure~~ <span style="color: red;">compared to <strong>wealth</strong> produced</span> _from the least productive **land** in use_.

We've already defined most of these terms: **rent**, **land**, **wealth**, **labor**, **capital**. The only undefined phrase is the "least productive **land** in use" &mdash; this just means the _cheapest available **land**_, or the **land** for which **rent** = 0. Our final definition is now:

> <mark>The <strong>rent</strong> of <strong>land</strong> is determined by the difference in <strong>wealth</strong> produced on it compared to <strong>wealth</strong> produced from the cheapest available <strong>land</strong>, given the same inputted <strong>labor</strong> and <strong>capital</strong>.</mark>

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnmAhkAJ0PM) provides a great explanation, but I've also come up with an example:

![Ricardo's Law of Rent example](/assets/img/ricardos_law_of_rent_example.png) **Figure 2: Ricardo's Law of Rent**

One might observe that this is simply _the law of competition_: <mark>the more <em>valuable</em> the <strong>land</strong> (the more <strong>wealth</strong> a <strong>laborer</strong> can create on it), the more <strong>rent</strong> he/she will pay for it.</mark>

### Rent, Wages, and Interest
Now that we have a law for [the distribution of **wealth** to] **rent**, we can tie in **wages** and **interest**. Remember, George is arguing that **wages**, **interest**, and **rent** are proportional: all of the **wealth** produced by **land** + **labor** + **capital** _must_ be used in the form of **rent** + **wages** + **interest**. This can be expressed algebraically:

<div style="text-align: center;"><mark><strong>Produce = Rent + Wages + Interest</strong></mark></div>

(I used the term "**produce**" instead of "**wealth**" above because that's what George does.) He then rearranges the equation to:

<div style="text-align: center;"><mark><strong>Produce â€“ Rent = Wages + Interest</strong></mark></div>

We now see that <mark><strong>wages</strong> are limited by <strong>rent</strong></mark>, since **rent** _must_ be extracted before **wages** and **interest** can be returned:

> "No matter what be the increase in productive power, if the increase in **rent** keeps pace with it, neither **wages** nor **interest** can increase." (171)

See [Addendum Quote 3](#quote-3) for George's full explanation of this concept.

## Chapter 3: Of Interest and the Cause of Interest
We now move on to the next law of **wealth** distribution, that of **interest**. Before determining the law itself, George spends time on question: _why does **interest** even exist?_

> "What is the reason and justification of **interest**? Why should the borrower pay back to the lender more than he received?" (175)

It's a good question. One could argue that the lender provides _nothing_ to the borrower, so long as the borrower pays back the full amount of **capital** they received. George provides one primary justification for the existence of <mark><strong>interest</strong>: the natural growth of <strong>wealth</strong> over time</mark>. Consider the example below.

### Example

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
Say you loan me 10 sheep for 1 year. I harvest their wool and return 10 sheep at the end of the year. Nothing changed for you, right? You still get 10 sheep back. But imagine you had kept the sheep yourself. You would've had _more_ than 10 sheep by the end of the year because the flock has grown, the ewes have had their lambs. Those extra sheep? That added **wealth**? That natural growth? That's **interest**, and George argues that it should be paid back along with the original 10 sheep.
</div>

In fact, many forms of **wealth** undergo this natural growth: wine improves with age, bees produce honey, etc. This increase in **wealth** &mdash; **interest** &mdash; doesn't apply everywhere, but due to the _interchangeability of wealth_, this effect must be averaged over all **wealth**.

> "It is this which is the cause of **interest**, or the increase of **capital** over and above that due to **labor**. There are ... in the movements which make up the everlasting flux of nature, certain vital currents, which will ... aid us, with a force independent of our own efforts, in turning matter into the forms we desire &mdash; that is to say, into **wealth**." (181)

In conclusion, <mark><strong>interest</strong> is a <em>naturally-occurring phenomenon</em> because the value of <strong>wealth</strong> &mdash; and therefore <strong>capital</strong> &mdash; <em>generally</em> increases over time.</mark> That increase is, in part, what's paid in return for the use of **wealth** (**capital**).

### Quick Note: Capital as Stored Labor

Before moving on to the next chapter, I'd like to briefly touch on one more thing that George mentions which seems almost contradictory to his other assertions:

> "If I plant and care for a tree until it comes to maturity, I receive, in its fruit, <mark><strong>interest</strong> upon the <strong>capital</strong> I have thus accumulated &mdash; that is, the <strong>labor</strong> I have expended.</mark> If I raise a cow, the milk which she yields me, morning and evening, is not merely the reward of the **labor** then exerted; but **interest** upon the **capital** which my **labor**, expended in raising her, has accumulated in the cow." (188)

In the quote above, George describes **interest** as something _other_ than natural forces. It is instead the result of accumulated **labor** in the **capital**: the effort I put [**labor**] into raising a cow [**capital**] results in a continuous supply of milk [**interest**]. George expounds on this idea of **capital** as stored **labor** more in [Chapter 5](#chapter-5-the-law-of-interest).

## Chapter 4: Of Spurious Capital and of Profits Often Mistaken for Interest
In the previous chapter, George explains the natural origin of **interest**. <mark><strong>Capital</strong>, like all <strong>wealth</strong>, generally experiences growth over time, which must be repaid after its use in the form of <strong>interest</strong>.</mark> This is not wrong or unjust.

There are, however, unnatural and wrong forms of profits [that is, **wealth**] masquerading as "**interest**": those due to [monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) and [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling). See [Addendum Quote 4](#quote-4) for George's words on monopoly. Regarding "risk", George has this to say:

> "Some people acquire **wealth** by taking chances which to the majority of people must necessarily bring loss. Such are many forms of speculation, and especially <mark>that mode of gambling known as <em>stock dealing</em></mark>. Nerve, judgment, the possession of **capital**, skill ... give advantage to the individual; <mark>but, just as at a gaming table, whatever one gains someone else must lose</mark>." (194)

This is really the crux of George's argument &mdash; his fundamental truth.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <mark><strong><span style="font-size: 150%;">Relative gains and losses are not wealth.</span></strong></mark>
</div>

Debts, exorbitant **rent**, gambling, etc. These things are _not_ **wealth**, despite what many believe.

## Chapter 5: The Law of Interest

I'll cut to the chase: it's impossible to determine a law of **interest** like we did for the law of **rent**. The "rules" or "behavior" of **interest** must always be thought of alongside **wages** because <mark><strong>labor</strong> and <strong>capital</strong> are inextricably linked.</mark> More precisely, the prices of **labor** and **capital** (**wages** and **interest** respectively) must form a balance because

> "Unless such an equilibrium were effected, **labor** would not accept the use of **capital**, or **capital** would not be placed at the disposal of **labor**. For **labor** and **capital** are but different forms of the same thing &mdash; human exertion. <mark><strong>Capital</strong> is produced by <strong>labor</strong>; it is, in fact</mark>, but **labor** impressed upon matter &mdash; <mark><strong>labor</strong> stored up in matter, to be released again as needed, as the heat of the sun stored up in coal is released in the furnace.</mark>" (198)

Furthermore, because **labor** and **capital** are the same, their returns &mdash; **wages** and **interest** &mdash; are positively correlated:

> "For if **wages** fall, **interest** must also fall in proportion, else it becomes more profitable to turn **labor** into **capital** than to apply it directly; while, if **interest** falls, **wages** must likewise proportionately fall, or else the increment of **capital** would be checked." (199)

_We already knew all this_ (see [Chapter 2](#chapter-2-rent-and-the-law-of-rent)'s formula or [Book 1: Wages and Capital](https://reneedesporte.github.io/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/)).

Finally, because **wages** and **interest** are really one and the same, George concludes this:

> "In truth, <mark>the primary division of <strong>wealth</strong> in distribution is <em>dual</em></mark>, not tripartite. In our examination we have ... sought the law which divides the **produce** between **rent** and **wages**..." (203)

![There is no law of interest](/assets/img/there_is_no_law_of_interest.jpg) **Figure 3: Self-explanatory**

## Chapter 6: Wages and the Law of Wages

> "The fundamental principle of human action &mdash; the law that is to political economy what the law of gravitation is to physics &mdash; is that <mark>men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion.</mark>" (204)

(I really appreciate George's comparison between economics to physics).

Actually, we can summarize this chapter rather quickly, since we still have our equation from [Chapter 2](#chapter-2-rent-and-the-law-of-rent). In a world where **land** can be freely used (we understand **capital** as equivalent to  **labor**):

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><mark>Wages</mark> <s>+ Interest</s> <mark>= Produce</mark> <s>â€“ Rent</s></strong>
</div>

Or in words:

> "Where **land** is free and **labor** is unassisted by **capital**, <mark><em>the whole <strong>produce</strong></em> will go to <strong>labor</strong> as <strong>wages</strong>.</mark>" (213)

Gosh... wouldn't that be nice? But this is often not the case...

> "<mark>Where natural opportunities [<strong>land</strong>] are all <em>monopolized</em>, <strong>wages</strong> may be forced</mark> by the competition among laborers <mark>to the minimum</mark> at which laborers will consent to reproduce." (213)

## Chapter 7: The Correlation and Coordination of these Laws
This chapter is a recapitulation of everything we've learned in Book 3 so far: **Rent**, **wages**, and **interest** are:
- positively correlated with **wealth** production, i.e., the more **wealth** produced from a **land** (or laborer or **capital**), the more **rent** (or **wages** or **interest**) can be charged;
- proportional within **wealth** production &mdash; "they spring from one point, support and supplement each other, and form the correlating divisions of a complete whole" (220).

## Chapter 8: The Statics of the Problem Thus Explained
Book 3 can be summarized in one phrase:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <mark><strong><span style="font-size: 200%;">Low wages are caused by high rent.</span></strong></mark>
</div>

We can see this in the formula from [Chapter 2](#chapter-2-rent-and-the-law-of-rent) and in anecdotal observations:
> "It is the general fact, observable everywhere, that <mark>as the value of <strong>land</strong> increases, so does the contrast between <strong>wealth</strong> and want appear</mark>... <mark>To see human beings in the most</mark> abject, the most helpless and <mark>hopeless condition, you must go</mark>, not to the unfenced prairies and the log cabins of new clearings in the backwoods, where man single-handed is commencing the struggle with nature, and **land** is yet worth nothing, but <mark>to the great cities, where the ownership of a little patch of round is a fortune.</mark>" (224)

But as always, I think an example is helpful.

### Example: Wages, Rent, and Interest

Let's imagine a world where the only forms of **labor**, **capital**, and **land** are fishing, fishing poles, and lakes respectively. If we start with a world in which **land** usage is free and and we employ no **capital** (we catch fish with our bare hands), we have a situation like this (see [Chapter 6](#chapter-6-wages-and-the-law-of-wages) for reference):

![Only labor](/assets/img/wages_rent_interest__fish_example_1.png) **Figure 4: Wealth distribution in the absence of rent and interest.**

All of our produced **wealth** is returned as **wages**. Now imagine we utilize a fishing pole (**capital**). We catch more fish, but we must pay some of that extra **wealth** back as **interest**:

![Labor and capital](/assets/img/wages_rent_interest__fish_example_2.png) **Figure 5: Wealth distribution in the absence of rent.**

Then, imagine **land** owners exist. Some portion of our **wealth** (fish) must now go back as **rent** for use of **land** (lakes):

![Labor, capital, and land](/assets/img/wages_rent_interest__fish_example_3.png) **Figure 6: Wealth distribution in a fair economy.**

The above is a picture of a normal, healthy economy. But let's imagine an _unfair_ economy, one in which _**rent** is very, very high_. Because **rent** must always be extracted first (see [Chapter 2](#chapter-2-rent-and-the-law-of-rent)), the portion of our **wealth** returned as **wages** and **interest** must go down:

![Wealth distribution in an unfair economy](/assets/img/wages_rent_interest__fish_example_4.png) **Figure 7: Wealth distribution in an unfair economy, where rent is exorbitant.**

This may leave the reader wondering...

# Addendum
### Quote 1
Fundamental definitions of **wealth**, **land**, **labor**, **capital**, **rent**, **wages**, and **interest**:

> "**Land**, **labor**, and **capital** are the factors of production [of **wealth**]. The term **land** includes all natural opportunities or forces; the term **labor**, all human exertion; and the term **capital**, all **wealth** used to produce more **wealth**. In returns to these three factors is the _whole **produce** distributed_. That part which goes to **land** owners as payment for the use of natural opportunities is called **rent**; that part which constitutes the reward of human exertion is called **wages**; and that part which constitutes the return for the use of **capital** is called **interest**. These terms _mutually exclude_ each other." (162)

### Quote 2
George on profits:

> "To talk about the distribution of **wealth** into **rent**, **wages**, and profits is like talking of the division of mankind into men, women, and human beings." (157)

### Quote 3
George on **land** value, **rent**, **wages**, and **interest**:

> "Where the value of **land** is low, there may be a small production of **wealth**, and yet a high rate of **wages** and **interest**, as we see in new countries. And, where the value of **land** is high, there may be a very large production of **wealth**, and yet a low rate of **wages** and **interest**, as we see in old countries. And, where productive power increases, as it is increasing in all progressive countries, **wages** and **interest** will be affected, not by the increase, but by the manner in which **rent** is affected. If the value of **land** increases proportionately, all the increased production will be swallowed up by **rent**, and **wages** and **interest** will remain as before. If the value of **land** increases in greater ratio than productive power, **rent** will swallow up even more than the increase; and while the **produce** of **labor** and **capital** will be much larger, **wages** and **interest** will fall." (172)

### Quote 4
George on the profits of monopolies commonly mistaken as **interest**:

> "Every one knows the tyranny and rapacity with which **capital** when _concentrated in large amounts_ is frequently wielded to corrupt, to rob, and to destroy. What I wish to call the reader's attention to is that profits thus derived are not to be confounded with the legitimate returns of **capital** as an agent of production." (193)
