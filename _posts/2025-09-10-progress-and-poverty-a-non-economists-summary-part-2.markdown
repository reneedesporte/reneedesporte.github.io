In [part 1](https://reneedesporte.github.io/2025/08/28/progress-and-poverty-a-non-economists-summary-part-1/) of my summary series for Henry George's [_Progress and Poverty_](https://cdn.mises.org/Progress%20and%20Poverty_3.pdf), I summarized "Book 1: Wages and Capital". In summary of my summary (lol), George asserts that **wages** are not derived from **capital** (see my last post for the definitions of those terms).

This post is part 2 of the series, summarizing Book 2 of _Progress and Poverty_: "Population and Subsistence". My goal is still conciseness, but I've provided an [addendum to this post](#addendum) for some of the juiciest Henry George quotes &mdash; he definitely has some mic drop moments.

# Book 2: Population and Subsistance
## Chapter 1: The The Malthusian Theory, Its Genesis and Support
The [Malthusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus) Theory states that **population** tends to outpace **subsistence**, i.e., that population's resources. George argues (see [Addendum Quote 1](#quote-1)) that this is essentially the same mindset as that of **wages** and **capital**. In my own words:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <mark>Existing economic belief: too many people, not enough stuff.</mark>
</div>

George argues that <mark>this belief system is problematic because it explains away low <strong>wages</strong> and high <strong>rent</strong> as <em>natural</em></mark>, &mdash; as natural as Darwin's Theory of Evolution &mdash; <mark>thereby diverting questioning, blame, or reform away from existing <strong>wealth</strong>-distribution systems</mark> (and those who benefit from them). In George's words:

> "The Malthusian doctrine parries the demand for reform, and shelters selfishness from question and from conscience by the interposition of an inevitable necessity." (George, 99)

It is

> "a theory that ... justifies the greed of the rich and the selfishness of the powerful..." (100)

## Chapter 2: Inferences from Facts
George argues that Malthus' theory is provably wrong.

### "Populations Grow at a Geometric Rate"
He first states that Malthus' observation on population growth rate (namely, that it's naturally geometric) doesn't apply to all populations &mdash; just some, e.g., poorer communities who are "devoting their energies to a struggle for mere existence" (104). George argues that more careful observation will reveal the truth:

> "Compared with its capacities to support human life the earth as a whole is yet most sparsely populated." (110)

In other words, humanity is observably _not_ pushing against Earth's resource limitations despite having existed as a species for eons.

### Is "Over-Population" Really the Cause of Suffering?

George acknowledges that there _do_ exist places where highly dense populations seem to correlate with suffering, e.g., China, India, and Ireland. However, he argues that this misery &mdash; famine, mostly &mdash; is not due to the limits of subsistence but rather the evil greed of the ruling class. 

India, for example, had suffered under avaricious kings for centuries only to be eventually placed under the British yoke of the East India Company. George quotes [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale), who observed India's suffering firsthand despite it being "the most fertile country in the world" (George, 119 &mdash; originally Nightingale, "The People of India", August, 1878).

Ireland, too, with its infamous Potato Famine was not starving because of Nature; rather, Ireland's English overlords were to blame (see [Quotes 8 and 9](#quotes-8-and-9)).

## Chapter 3: Inferences from Analogy

George further refutes Malthus' theory (that the human population will eventually outgrow its resources) by observing that humanity has the ability to _increase_ its resources over time via **cultivation**.

> "There are now forty-five millions of men [in the U.S.] where then there were only a few hundred thousand, and yet there is now within that territory much more food per capita for the forty-five millions than there was then for the few hundred thousand. <mark>It is not the increase of food that has caused this increase of men; but the increase of men that has brought about the increase of food.</mark>" (131)

He notes that

> "While vegetables and animals do press against the limits of subsistence, man cannot press against the limits of his subsistence until the limits of the globe are reached." (132)

I think it's important to note here that George doesn't believe humanity can seriously disrupt Nature (which contains the whole of humanity's resources). He seemingly doesn't believe humanity's actions can have serious negative impacts on the environment (see also [Quote 11](#quote-11)):

> "Life does not use up the forces that maintain life." (133)

## Chapter 4: Disproof of the Malthusian Theory

George denies Malthus' theory:

> <mark>"I assert that in a state of equality the natural increase of population would constantly tend to make every individual richer instead of poorer."</mark> (142)

In support of his assertion, George tells us to look at the facts — instead of examining the relationship between population and poverty, we should watch population and **wealth**. It can't be denied that world is much wealthier than ever, despite population growth. This, George argues, is due to the _improved efficiency of **labor**_ by a dense population, which is enabled by:

- the population's previously-produced **capital**: roads, ships, fertilizers, etc.
- the "minute ... subdivision of **labor**," which causes "greater ... economies of production and distribution" (150)

# Conclusion
George refutes Malthus' theory that population growth is exponential and will one day outpace subsistence production. He argues that this widely accepted school of thought is not only wrong but damaging, as it frames poverty as a natural phenomenon, immutable despite social or policy change.

George still has not answered his original question of progress and poverty. But he ends his discussion on Malthus with this note:

> "It is this very fact &mdash; that want appears where productive power is greatest and the production of **wealth** is largest &mdash; that constitutes the enigma which perplexes the civilized world, and which we are trying to unravel. Evidently the Malthusian theory, which attributes want to the decrease of productive power, will not explain it." (150)

# Addendum

### Quote 1

George, on the similarities between the **wages**-**capital** relationship (Adam Smith and others) and the **population**-**subsistence** relationship (Malthus): 

> "According to the current doctrine of **wages**, **wages** _fall_ as increase in the number of laborers necessitates a more minute _division_ of **capital**; according to the Malthusian theory, poverty appears as _increase_ in **population** necessitates the more minute _division_ of **subsistence**." (97)

### Quote 2

George explaining the historical context into which Malthus published [_An Essay on the Principle of Population_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population):

> "[Malthus's essay] was avowedly a reply to William Godwin's "[Inquiry concerning Political Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enquiry_Concerning_Political_Justice)," a work asserting the principle of human equality; and its [Malthus'] purpose was to justify existing inequality by shifting the responsibility for it from human institutions to the laws of the Creator... [Malthus' ideas were] peculiarly grateful to a powerful class, in whom an intense fear of any questioning of the existing state of things had been generated by the outburst of the French Revolution." (98 — 99)

### Quote 3

George explaining how the Malthusian belief system renders reform as pointless:

> "Even if the rich were literally to obey the injunctions of Christ and divide their **wealth** among the poor, nothing would be gained. Population would be increased, only to press again upon the limits of subsistence or **capital**, and the equality that would be produced would be but the equality of common misery. And thus reforms which would interfere with the interests of any powerful class are discouraged as hopeless." (99)

### Quote 4

George pointing out the absurdity of Malthus' assumptions on population growth and subsistence rates:

> "It [Malthus' book] begins with the assumption that population tends to increase in a geometrical ratio, while subsistence can at best be made to increase only in an arithmetical ratio-an assumption just as valid, and no more so, than it would be, from the fact that a puppy doubled the length of his tail while he added so many pounds to his weight, to assert a geometric progression. of tail and an arithmetical progression of weight." (104)

### Quotes 5 and 6

See pages 113 – 121 for George's explanation on the horrors of British rule in India, e.g., 

> "The millions of India have bowed their necks beneath the yokes of many conquerors, but worst of all is the steady, grinding weight of English domination &mdash; a weight which is literally crushing millions out of existence, and, as shown by English writers, is inevitably tending to a most frightful and widespread catastrophe." (117)
and

> "Even from famine stricken districts, food is exported in payment of taxes, and how the whole of India is subjected to a steady and exhausting drain, which, combined with the enormous expenses of government, is making the population year by year poorer." (119) 

### Quote 7

George on why India and China are so impoverished despite their **wealth** of natural resources:

> "It is not dense population, but the causes which prevent social organization from taking its natural development and **labor** from securing its full return, that keep millions just on the verge of starvation, and every now and again force millions beyond it." (122)

### Quotes 8 and 9

On the Irish Potato Famine:

> "Had this food been left to those who raised it; had the cultivators of the soil been permitted to retain and use the **capital** their **labor** produced; had security stimulated industry and permitted the adoption of economical methods, there would have been enough to support in bounteous comfort the largest population Ireland ever had, and the potato blight might have come and gone without stinting a single human being of a full meal." (125)
and 

> "Whether over-population ever did cause pauperism and starvation, may be an open question; but the pauperism and starvation of Ireland can no more be attributed to this cause than can the slave trade be attributed to the over-population of Africa..." (127) 

### Quote 10

On man's ability to **cultivate** the **land**, thereby increasing **subsistence** alongside **population**:

> "<mark>Here is a difference between the animal and the man.</mark> Both the jay-hawk and the man eat chickens, but the more jay-hawks the fewer chickens, while the more men the more chickens. Both the seal and the man eat salmon, but when a seal takes a salmon there is a salmon the less, and were seals to increase past a certain point salmon must diminish; while by placing the spawn of the salmon under favorable conditions man can so increase the number of salmon as more than to make up for all he may take, and thus, no matter how much men may increase, their increase need never outrun the supply of salmon. In short, <mark>while all through the vegetable and animal kingdoms the limit of subsistence is independent of the thing subsisted, with man the limit of subsistence is</mark>, within the final limits of earth, air, water, and sunshine, <mark>dependent upon man himself.</mark>" (131–132)

### Quote 11

On the impossibility of man to negatively disrupt Nature or the Earth: 

> "For that man cannot exhaust or lessen the powers of nature follows from the indestructibility of matter and the persistence of force. Production and consumption are only relative terms. Speaking absolutely, man neither produces nor consumes. The whole human race, were they to **labor** to infinity, could not make this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter, could not add to or diminish by one iota the sum of the forces whose everlasting circling produces all motion and sustains all life."
